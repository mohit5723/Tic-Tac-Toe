# Tic Tac Toe 

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is played on a 3x3 grid where two players, traditionally represented by "X" and "O," take turns marking empty cells. 
The objective is to form a line of three of their symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before their opponent does.
The first player, often "X," strives to occupy the center square initially, as it provides the greatest opportunity to win.
The player can also play for a draw if their opponent does not make a critical mistake. 
The player going second, typically "O," aims to create a defensive strategy to counter the first player's attempts and, if possible, seize a victory opportunity. 
The game's depth emerges from recognizing these strategies and anticipating the opponent's moves.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
